Day 1
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AXDli9tQMo (5:00): The guy in the video discussed the basics of embedded systems. He defined embedded systems as a combination of hardware and software that work as one. The software is more specific than a regular computer because it has only one purpose or related purposes to help the hardware in the system function. This would include a thermostat or camera or even a plane. He discussed the advances in computer chip technology and microprocessors that impact embedded systems, and he discussed careers related to embedded systems engineering, especially in the field of computer engineering.
